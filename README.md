## Research Study Designs of Covid-19 Clinical Trials Worldwide 
This project uses a dataset of Covid-19 related clinical trials worldwide collected from clinicaltrials.gov. The purpose is to analyze and visualize the different types of clinical trials (eg. study design, study purpose, study time-scale, experimental blinding, etc.) The data was cleaned and analyzed in Python, and then loaded into Tableau for further visualization. The Tableau dashboard allows for filtering by country and by study-type by clicking on the plots in the filters pane on the right side of the dashboard.
